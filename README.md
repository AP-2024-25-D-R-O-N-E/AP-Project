General list of stuff needed for the project.
- [ ] Config file from .toml
- [ ] Initializing network:
    - [ ] initialize drones
    - [ ] initialize clients
    - [ ] initialize servers
- [ ] Define a good way to structure the project in modules
- [ ] assembler and disassembler algorithm (the implementation is for the individuals who'll code the client and the server)
- [ ] Drone behaviour:
    - [ ] handling packets
        - [ ] handling messages, with PDR. Send errors and dropped if needed
        - [ ] handling NACKs and ACKs (basically just forwarding the packet)
        - [ ] handling Query for the flooding algorithm
        - [ ] handling QueryResult (just forwarding the packet)
    - [ ] handling simulation controller commands
        - [ ] we're waiting for the WG to determine which commands drones need to listen to
- [ ] Client/Server behaviour:
    - [ ] implementing the assembler
    - [ ] implementing the disassembler
    - [ ] handling packets
        - [ ] msg fragments need to be stored inside a buffer, when you have all the buffers they're "sent" to the assembler
        - [ ] NACKs need to be processed, usually resulting in a resent packet and/or an internal "topology" change
        - [ ] Query needs to have fixed behaviour, will check at WG
        - [ ] QueryResult needs to update the topology
    - [ ] handling commands from simulation controller (client only)
        - [ ] we need to define if user input (like clients sending a message or requesting a file) is done through the simulation controller
    - [ ] handling received requests and responding with a new message, which is sent through the disassembler
- [ ] Simulation controller:
    - [ ] initialization
    - [ ] GUI for visualizing topology and moving packets
    - [ ] inputs for sending commands to nodes
    - [ ] listening to events from nodes and handling them accordingly (usually with a responsive GUI element)
